            <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>BASIC-ETL:</b> I led a team of four to develop a basic ETL process. The project was developed using Python, and MySQL was used to store and maintain the data.</li>
                <li><b>Sentiment Analysis:</b> The main objective of this project is to find the sentiment of the given input. This project dataset was collected from hotel reviews, and NLTK packages were used to train and test the model.</li>
                <li><b>TIME SERIES FORECASTING:</b> The main moto for building this project is to find the trend of the customers who travel through flights. For building the model the dataset used is Air Passengers which contains the monthly wise no. of passengers list. I used three types of ARIMA models to train and test to build the model.</li>
                <li><b>ML_PRO:</b> ML-pro is a machine learning project, it is a tool which helps to run all types of machine learning operations and algorithms, it also helps to evaluate and display plots based on the given data.</li>
                <li><b>Doctor's Handwriting Prediction:</b> I led a team of four to develop the doctor’s handwriting prediction project. The project was developed for a hackathon using Python, and Computer Vision packages using Tensor-flow, Keras and NLP techniques to predict the words more accurately from the doctor’s prescription.</li>
                <li><b>READ_PAPER</b> On-going project</li>
            </ul>
